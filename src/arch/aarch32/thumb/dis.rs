/// Disassemble the instruction at `p` in `mem`.

/// This function returns:
/// 
///  * A string representation of the instruction encountered, if there is a
///    valid instruction at P; otherwise `None`
///  * The offset to the next instruction, usually also the size of the current
///    instruction, except for architectures with polynomial program counters.
///  * is_nonfinal: If true, the next instruction is implicitly a target of the
///    current instruction.
///  * is_nonbranching: If true, the current instruction does not end the
///    current block.
///  * A list of pointers containing all statically known jump and call targets
///    from the instruction. Instructions with dynamic or unknown jump targets
///    must be expressed as None. The next instruction is implied as a target
///    if is_nonfinal is returned as True and does not need to be provided here.
